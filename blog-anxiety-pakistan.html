            <p><strong>"Is it a heart attack?"</strong> This is often the first thought when a panic attack strikes.
                Your heart races, your palms sweat, and you feel like you can't breathe. In emergency rooms across
                Lahore and Karachi, thousands of patients present with these physical symptoms every month, only to be
                told, "It's just stress."</p>

            <p>But anxiety is not "just" anything. It is a debilitating condition that affects millions of Pakistanis.
                Recent studies estimate that nearly <strong>34% of the population</strong> suffers from anxiety and
                depression, with numbers rising sharply to over 57% during recent crisis periods.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Key Statistic</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0;">Women in Pakistan are disproportionately affected, being <strong>twice as
                        likely</strong> as men to experience severe anxiety due to societal pressures and household
                    responsibilities.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Cultural Barrier: "Log Kya Kahenge"</h2>
            <p>In our society, mental health is often misunderstood. We have all heard the labels—<em>"Kamzor eman"</em>
                (weak faith), <em>"Nafsiyati"</em> (mental), or simply <em>"Drama seeking"</em>. This stigma creates a
                massive barrier to healing.</p>
            <p>Many of my clients tell me they hid their symptoms for years because they were afraid of bringing shame
                to their families. They suffered in silence, praying for relief, not realizing that anxiety is a
                treatable health condition, just like diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>

            <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Anxiety doesn't always look like fear. In Pakistan, we often "somatize" our stress, meaning we feel it in
                our bodies. Common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gastrointestinal Issues:</strong> Constant upset stomach, gas, or "gola" in the throat.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Pain:</strong> Unexplained back pain, headaches, or muscle tension.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusive Thoughts:</strong> Constant worry about the safety of loved ones or financial
                    ruin.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Skipping family weddings or gatherings to avoid social judgment (Social
                    Anxiety).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Online Therapy Works Better for Us</h2>
            <p>For many Pakistanis, especially women and busy professionals, traditional in-person therapy has hurdles:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Complete Privacy</h3>
            <p>There is no waiting room where you might run into a neighbor or relative. You speak from your safe space,
                and your identity remains confidential.</p>

            <h3>2. Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Whether you are in a remote area or stuck in Islamabad traffic, help is just a click away. You don't need
                to commute for an hour to see a good psychologist.</p>

            <h3>3. Comfort of Language</h3>
            <p>Therapy works best when you can express yourself in your mother tongue. We conduct sessions in
                <strong>Urdu, English, Punjabi, and Pashto</strong>, so you never have to struggle to find the right
                word for your feelings.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Treat Anxiety</h2>
            <p>At <em>Healing with Attia</em>, we use evidence-based approaches like <strong>Cognitive Behavioral
                    Therapy (CBT)</strong>. We work together to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the "negative automatic thoughts" fueling your fear.</li>
                <li>Learn breathing and grounding techniques to stop panic attacks in their tracks.</li>
                <li>Gradually face your fears in a safe, supportive environment.</li>
            </ul>
