            <p><strong>"I feel like I am living in a fishbowl."</strong> "I can't even argue with my husband without
                someone knocking on the door." "My mother-in-law rearranges my kitchen while I'm at work."</p>

            <p>The joint family system is the bedrock of Pakistani culture, celebrated for its support and shared
                responsibility. But for many couples—especially new daughters-in-law—it can become a source of profound
                <strong>loss of autonomy and chronic stress.</strong>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">The #1 Stressor</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0;">In my clinical practice, <strong>over 60% of marital counseling cases</strong>
                    stem
                    not from issues between the couple, but from interference by extended family members.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The "Sandwich Generation" Dilemma</h2>
            <p>It's not just the women who suffer. Men often find themselves "sandwiched" between their parents (whom
                they must respect religiously) and their wives (whose rights they must protect). This constant
                tug-of-war
                leads to burnout, emotional withdrawal, and resentment on all sides.</p>

            <h2>3 Strategies to Protect Your Peace</h2>

            <h3>1. Physical Boundaries vs. Emotional Boundaries</h3>
            <p>You may not be able to move out immediately due to financial or cultural reasons. That is a reality we
                must accept. However, you can build <em>emotional walls</em>. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not sharing every detail of your marriage with your in-laws.</li>
                <li>Politely declining unsolicited advice ("Thank you for the suggestion, I'll think about it" instead
                    of
                    arguing).</li>
                <li>Carving out "sacred time" with your spouse inside your room where family topics are banned.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Art of "Respectful Assertiveness"</h3>
            <p>In our culture, saying "no" is seen as disrespect (badtameezi). We need to reframe it. You can be kind
                while being firm.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> Instead of saying "Don't come into my room without knocking!", try: "I need some
                private
                time to rest after work, so I'll be keeping the door closed from 5 to 6 PM. I'll join everyone for tea
                afterwards."</p>

            <h3>3. Communicating as a Team</h3>
            <p>For husbands and wives, the golden rule is: <strong>Public Unity, Private Disagreement.</strong> Never
                contradict your spouse in front of parents. If your mother criticizes your wife's cooking, defend her
                gently
                in public ("I actually like it this way, Ammi"), and discuss any improvements privately later.</p>

            <h2>When Boundaries Fail</h2>
            <p>Living in a high-conflict joint family can sometimes lead to clinical depression or anxiety. If you feel
                constant dread coming home, it may be time to speak to a neutral third party.</p>
            <p>Therapy can provide you with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication scripts that actually work.</li>
                <li>A safe space to vent without judgment.</li>
                <li>Clarity on whether the environment is truly "toxic" or just "difficult."</li>
            </ul>
