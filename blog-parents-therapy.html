            <p><strong>"You have a roof over your head and food on the table. What do you have to be depressed
                    about?"</strong></p>

            <p>If you have ever tried to tell your parents you are feeling anxious or sad, you might have heard this. Or
                worse: <em>"Just pray more."</em> In Pakistan, the generation gap regarding mental health is massive.
                Our
                parents grew up in a survival mode where feelings were a luxury they could not afford.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">The Biggest Barrier</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0;">For young adults (18-25) in Pakistan, <strong>lack of parental approval</strong>
                    is the #1 reason they do not seek therapy, even when they are suffering from severe depression.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Are They So Resistant?</h2>
            <p>Before getting angry, try to understand their fear. To a Pakistani parent, having a child with "mental
                issues" means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shame:</strong> "People will think we failed as parents."</li>
                <li><strong>Marriageability:</strong> "Who will marry you if they find out you see a psychologist?"</li>
                <li><strong>Faith:</strong> "If you are sad, it means your connection with Allah is weak."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Scripts: How to Have "The Talk"</h2>
            <p>Do not use clinical words like "Trauma" or "Depression" initially. They sound scary. Use language they
                understand.</p>

            <h3>1. Frame it as "Coaching" or "Guidance"</h3>
            <p><strong>Don't say:</strong> "I need therapy because I'm depressed."<br>
                <strong>Do say:</strong> "Everything is getting very competitive these days, and I want to learn some
                focus techniques from a professional to do better in my studies/career. It's like a tutor for my mind."
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use the Religious Argument</h3>
            <p>Islam prioritizes mental health. The Prophet (PBUH) experienced sadness (The Year of Sorrow). Remind
                them: <strong>"Allah says to tie your camel and then trust in Him. Therapy is tying the camel. Prayer is
                    trusting Him."</strong></p>

            <h3>3. Address the Money Issue</h3>
            <p>If cost is the barrier, show them the value. "I am struggling to focus. If I spend 3000 rupees on seeing
                a doctor now, I will save my semester fees from being wasted."</p>

            <h2>"What if the therapist tells you to hate us?"</h2>
            <p>This is a secret fear many parents have. Reassure them: "A doctor's job is not to judge you. It is to
                help me handle stress so I can be a better, calmer daughter/son around the house."</p>
