            <p>Marriage in Pakistan is rarely just about two people; it is the union of two families. While the
                <strong>Joint Family System</strong> offers specialized support networks and financial stability, it is
                also cited as one of the leading causes of marital stress in the country.</p>

            <p>From decision-making power to privacy invasion, the lines often get blurred. A husband often finds
                himself being the "sandwich" between his mother and his wife, while the wife feels her autonomy is
                stripping away.</p>

            <h2>The "Privacy" Problem</h2>
            <p>In a busy household, intimacy—both emotional and physical—often takes a backseat. Couples find little
                time to connect without interruption or judgment.
                <br><br>
                Common complaints I hear in therapy include:
                <br><em>"My mother-in-law decides what we cook every day."</em>
                <br><em>"We can't fight without the whole house knowing."</em>
                <br><em>"My husband doesn't stand up for me."</em>
            </p>

            <h2>Why Venting to Friends Doesn't Work</h2>
            <p>When issues arise, we often turn to friends or family. But family is biased, and friends may just
                validate your anger effectively "adding fuel to the fire."
                <br>
                This can lead to triangulation, where you talk <em>about</em> your partner instead of <em>to</em> them.
            </p>

            <h2>The Role of a Neutral Third Party</h2>
            <p>Couples therapy acts as a bridge. It is a neutral ground where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We Don't Take Sides:</strong> The therapist is an advocate for the <em>relationship</em>,
                    not the husband or the wife.</li>
                <li><strong>Translation of Emotions:</strong> We help you translate "You never listen!" (Accusation)
                    into "I feel lonely when you're on your phone" (Vulnerability).</li>
                <li><strong>Navigating In-Laws:</strong> We teach you how to set respectful but firm boundaries with
                    extended family, presenting a united front as a couple.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>It's Not Weakness, It's Wisdom</h2>
            <p>In our culture, seeking help for marriage is seen as a sign that "it's over." In reality, the most
                successful couples are those who seek help early, before resentment builds up. Whether you need
                pre-marital counseling or support during a rough patch, investing in your relationship is the best gift
                you can give your future family.</p>
