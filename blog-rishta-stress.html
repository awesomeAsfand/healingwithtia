                name." "They just looked at me and left without drinking the chai."</p>

            <p>If you are a young person in Pakistan, these sentences probably sound painfully familiar. The "Rishta
                Parade"—the process where families visit to evaluate a potential spouse—is a cultural reality. But for
                many, it is also a source of deep <strong>anxiety, lowered self-esteem, and depression.</strong></p>

                <p style="margin: 0;">Repeated rejection during the rishta process is a leading cause of
                    <strong>Body Dysmorphia</strong> and <strong>Social Anxiety</strong> among young women and men in
                    Pakistan, yet it is rarely discussed as a mental health issue.

            <h2>Why It Hurts So Much</h2>
            <p>It is not just about a meeting; it feels like an interview for your worthiness as a human being. When you
                are rejected based on superficial traits like height, skin color (rangat), or salary, it attacks your
                core identity.</p>
            <p>Common emotional impacts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Defectiveness" Schema:</strong> Believing deep down that there is something "wrong"
                    with you.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparisonitis:</strong> Obsessively comparing yourself to cousins or friends who "got
                    picked" easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Parental Pressure:</strong> Feeling guilty for "stressing out" your parents by not getting
                    married.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3 Ways to Protect Your Mental Health</h2>

            <h3>1. Separate Your Self-Worth from the Outcome</h3>
            <p>You are a complete person—with dreams, kindness, talent, and faith. A rejection is often about
                <em>their</em>
                preferences (or demands for dowry/status), not about <em>your</em> value. If someone rejects you because
                you wear glasses or speak a certain way, they are doing you a favor. They are showing you that they
                would not have cherished the real you.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Set Boundaries with "The Feedback"</h3>
            <p>Well-meaning aunties often relay hurtful feedback: "Tell her to lose weight." You have the right to tell
                your parents: <strong>"Please do not share negative feedback with me unless it is constructive. It hurts
                    me, and I don't need to hear it."</strong></p>

            <h3>3. Take Breaks</h3>
            <p>You cannot be "on display" 24/7. It is exhausting. If you have seen three families this month and feel
                drained, ask your parents for a "Rishta Detox" month. Use that time to reconnect with things that make
                you feel capable—your job, your hobbies, or your friends.</p>

            <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
            <p>It is normal to feel sad after a rejection. But if you find yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crying daily or feeling hopeless about the future.</li>
                <li>Avoiding social gatherings because you fear questions about your marriage.</li>
                <li>Believing you are "unlovable."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then it might be time to speak to a professional. Therapy can help you rebuild the self-esteem that this
                process chips away at.</p>

                <p>You don't have to face the judgment alone. Let's rebuild your confidence together.</p>
